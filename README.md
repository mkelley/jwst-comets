# jwst-comets

Tools, tips, tricks for comet observations with JWST.  Some may even be useful for asteroids.

* For Exposure Time Calculator tips and a tool for estimating comet brightness, see [estimations](estimations/).
* For Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT) tips and a tool for visualizing moving targets in APT, see [apt-targets](apt-targets/).
* For some tips measuring astrometry with NIRCam, see [astrometry](astrometry/).
* To plot the fields of view of JWST data with respect to a moving target position, see [instrument-fov](instrument-fov/).
* For some tips on processing NIRSpec data, see [nirspec](nirspec/).
* I tried to do some cube cleaning on MIRI data with mixed results, see [cube-cleaning](cube-cleaning/)
